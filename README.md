# MarioGame
Remember that first mario game that you got your hands on when you were just a kid, this game is something like that but in a reduce version. This project was something I built when I just started out learning how to programme.

# Aim Of The Game
The objective is for the player to get as many points as possible by collecting the chests located at different parts of the game, before reaching the final checkpoint to win. The player will start off with 3 lives. Players lives will be deducted if they fall down the canyon or touch one of the "enemies".

# :hammer: The Process
I started off by creating the background of the entire game with the mountains and the clouds in mind. Just a basic background to start things off. Thereafter, I followed up by creating the foreground which is the main area that most of the player interaction will happen. The foreground consist of the trees, canyon, ground area, and the chests. 

Once the background and foreground were complete, I then created a scrolling mechanism which gives the effect that the character is moving through the set area once It reaches a certain location.

I then created character which was just a basic box figure with different movement dynamics that will display when the character moves left, right or jump. Once that was done I moved on to greating the game logic that will run the entire game.

Finally, I added some sounds to the different character movements and to the game logic, for example when the character jump, dies and when the character has reached the end point.

# :books: What I Learned
Through this projects I picked up important skills on the basics of Javascript and Game Logic, which in turn improved my understanding of the different concept and improved my logical thinking.

# :thought_balloon: What can be Improved?
- Add more playing area to the game
- Improve the look and feel of the character 
- Improve the background
